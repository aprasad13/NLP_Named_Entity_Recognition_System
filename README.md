# NLP_Named_Entity_Recognition_System

In this project is the implementation of <strong>Named Entity Recognition System</strong> using <strong>LSTMs</strong> with Trax. 

NER is a subtask of information extraction that locates and classifies named entities in a text. The named entities could be organizations, persons, locations, times, etc.
